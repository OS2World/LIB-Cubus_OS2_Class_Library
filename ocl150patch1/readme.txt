These files should replace the older ones from the last OCL Release.

- I patched ODate as suggested by Reinhard Schuerer to fix the bug in ODate::asString
- I fixed the "bug" mentioned by Phil in OXcptBase :-))
- I implemented some cosmetics to OStatusLine (3D-style)

Simply replace the files and recompile the libraries.
