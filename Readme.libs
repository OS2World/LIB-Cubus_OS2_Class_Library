The libraries are compiled using the Warp Toolkit and the flag

#define __TK30__

So the libs cannot be used for OS/2 2.x. In case you're running
OS/2 2.x you have to recompile the libraries using your compiler
and the Developers Toolkit for OS/2 2.x. Please define the macro

#define __TK21__
or
#define __OCL_OS2_2X__

in your common header os2.h or prior to 

#include <ocl.hpp>

for compatibility with OS/2 2.x.
